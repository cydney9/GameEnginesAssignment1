Game Play: The goal is to collect the darker coloured squares, and bring them to the corresponding brighter coloured squares, before the timer runs out. An example can be to bring the dark red square to the bright red square. The player can only hold one item at a time.

Player control: Use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move the yellow square around the field. Press the space key to restart level, if the player is stuck.
